<p align="center">An End-to-End Encryption Protocol Tailored for Social Network Platforms.</p>

# Motivation

End-to-end encryption has become a de facto standard in messengers, especially after the outbreak of the highly secure messaging protocol â€“ Signal. However, this high adoption of secure end-to-end communications has been limited to messengers, and has not yet seen a noticeable trace in social network platforms. The Stick protocol is an end-to-end encryption protocol, based on the Signal protocol, specifically designed for social networks, and will be the protocol powering STiiiCK. The Stick protocol supports re-establishable "many-to-many" encryption sessions in an asynchronous and multi-device setting while preserving forward secrecy and introducing backward secrecy.
